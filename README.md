# Rubik Cube algorithms
Obsidian plugin one can use to visualize Rubik Cubes algorithms.

Right now, it is able to show PLL algorithms only.
Working on OLL and F2L.

A normal usecase would look like this image.
A cube with some arrows, followed by your favourite algorithm to solve it:

This exact image is created by writing the following codeblock (named 'twistyCubePll'):
```
dimension:3,3
arrows:4+8,3+9
```

## Possible configuration
- the cube's size, width and height from 2 to 10
- the cube's color, 3- or 6- digit hex-value
- the arrows' color, 3- or 6- digit hex-value
- arrow coordinates

## Default configuration
```twistyCubePll
dimension:3,3 // width, height
cubeColor:ff0 // yellow background 
arrowColor:08f // sky blue arrows
// no arrows
```

## Some Examples
```
dimension:2,2 // width, height
arrows:1.1-1.2
```
Would create a 2x2 Cube with an arrow from the first to the second rectangle in the first row.
Arrow coordinates go from top-left to bottom-right. First integer is row, second integer is column.
```
dimension:2,2
arrows:1-2 // "lazy" coordinates
```
Would create the same. Notice the "lazy" arrow coordinates.
It just gives each rectangle an integer. 
```
dimension:2,2
arrows:1+2 // "+" makes this a double-sided arrow
```
Would create the same, but with a double-sided arrow.
```
dimension:2,2
cubeColor:0f0 // green, no "#" for hex value
arrowColor:f00 // red, "ff0000" is also possible
arrows:1-2
```
Would create the same, but with a red arrow on a green cube.

## Things that will come
- OLL visualization
- F2L visualization
- plugin settings


This is my first public repository and plugin, please be gentle :)
