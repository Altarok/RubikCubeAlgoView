# Visualization of Rubik's Cube algorithms: OLL & PLL
Obsidian plugin you can use to visualize Rubik's Cubes algorithms.

Ever wondered how an algorithm would look like after turning a cube?
Well with this you can.

# Features
- Visualize OLL and PLL algorithms
- Visualize arrows, defined by you
- Algorithms as well as arrow- and cube-colors set by you
- Buttons: rotate cube, reset cube rotation
- Algorithms change according to rotation

# How to install
- At the moment, you must use BRAT to install it: https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat

# Where to start?
- You may copy markdown (.md) files from this folder directly into your obsidian vault: https://github.com/Altarok/RubikCubeAlgoView/tree/main/markdown-examples
- The plugin features two commands to insert code block templates into your note
